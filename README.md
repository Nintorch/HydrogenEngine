# Hydrogen Engine
A (WIP) simple 2D game engine with "Sega Genesis-styled" graphics.
It mainly started as a small project to practice the C programming language.

It uses SDL2 as the main library, SDL_Surface as all the renderable 8-bit (indexed) surfaces/textures
and SDL_Renderer to render the 8-bit framebuffer to the screen.

Sonic sprites are used just for testing, if this project is going to be in a finished state some time
they are not going to be included there.
