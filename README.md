# Hydrogen Engine
A (WIP) simple 2D game engine with "Sega Genesis-styled" graphics.
It mainly started as a small project to practice the C programming language.

It uses SDL2 as the main library, SDL_Surface as all the renderable 8-bit (indexed) surfaces/textures
and SDL_Renderer to render the 8-bit framebuffer to the screen.

Sonic sprites are used just for testing, if this project is going to be in a finished state some time
they are not going to be included there.

## Prerequisites
Libraries are to be stored in libs/ folder, with their include files to be in libs/(Library)/include folder.
- SDL2
- SDL2_gfx (for SDL_Surface rotation)
- SDL2_image (for .png file loading)

## Copyrights
- Sonic and related characters (C) Sega and Sonic Team
- Sega Genesis (C) Sega
